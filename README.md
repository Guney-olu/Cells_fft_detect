# How it helped 

The high-frequency components, after removing the central spike, can enhance the edges in the image. This ca 	help in tasks where edge detection or feature extraction is important, such as object recognition, segmentat	ion, or image classificati on

Fourier domain filtering  also help us in reducing noise in the image, especially if the noise is predominantly in the low-frequency range. Removing the central spike can suppress low-frequency noise, making the image cleaner and potentially improving subsequent processing step
